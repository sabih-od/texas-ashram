                                <p>For more than 80 years, individuals and families have attended Christian Ashram
                                    retreats all
                                    around the world to find rest and recreation, encouraging teaching, and
                                    meaningful
                                    friendship. Each retreat offers a life-transforming opportunity to focus on
                                    JESUS in
                                    the
                                    midst of other people who believe in the hope of God's unshakable kingdom.</p>
                                <p>We recognize that each person is at a different place in life. One thing we have
                                    in
                                    common,
                                    is that life is tough sometimes. Sometimes we just need to unplug from all of
                                    lifeâ€™s
                                    stressors and proactively focus on Jesus to recharge. If you are looking for a
                                    place
                                    to have
                                    fun, recharge, learn, and grow in faith, surrounded by a group of fellow
                                    believers,
                                    this is
                                    the place for you and your family.</p>
                                <p>Our retreats are designed to provide a well-rounded experience, with inspiring
                                    teaching,
                                    uplifting worship, and engaging fellowship for all age groups. You'll have the
                                    opportunity
                                    to participate in small group discussions, reflective times of prayer, and fun
                                    recreational
                                    activities.</p>
                                <p>We believe that rest and recreation are important parts of spiritual growth, so
                                    we
                                    also offer
                                    a variety of recreational activities such as hiking, swimming, and games.</p>

                                            The
                                            atmosphere was so welcoming and inclusive, and I felt an immediate
                                            connection with
                                            the other attendees. The teachings were inspiring and the activities
                                            were
                                            fun and
                                            engaging. I left feeling renewed and refreshed, with a stronger
                                            connection
                                            to God
                                            and my community.</p>

                                        <p>As a parent, it can be challenging to find a spiritual retreat that
                                            accommodates the
                                            needs of the entire family. The Texas Christian Ashram was the perfect
                                            solution for
                                            us. Our children had a blast participating in age-appropriate
                                            activities,
                                            while my
                                            spouse and I were able to deepen our faith through the adult programs.
                                            We
                                            left
                                            feeling closer to each other and closer to God.</p>

                                        <p>I had the privilege of attending the Texas Christian Ashram with a group
                                            of
                                            friends,
                                            and it was an experience I will never forget. The retreat provided a
                                            peaceful and
                                            contemplative space to connect with God and reflect on my spiritual
                                            journey.
                                            The
                                            guest speakers were knowledgeable and inspiring, and the activities were
                                            both fun
                                            and thought-provoking. I would highly recommend the Texas Christian
                                            Ashram
                                            to anyone
                                            seeking a deeper connection with their faith.</p>
